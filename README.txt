js.css3mediaqueries
*******************

Introduction
============

This library packages `css3-mediaqueries.js`_ for `fanstatic`_. It is aware
of different modes (normal, minified).

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`css3-mediaqueries.js`: https://github.com/livingston/css3-mediaqueries-js

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.css3mediaqueries``) are published to some URL.
